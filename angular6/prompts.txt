So this project is intended to be a frontend for a connect 4 game that i am developing the game is hosted by a flask application and the client will send moves to the server and display the board. Can you help me generate the starting code for this application and  replace the default home page with this generated code

so the backend sends the board in the format of a nested array that looks like {"board": [ [0,0,0 ..], [0,0,0, ..] .. ] here there each child array will represent a row and in each row th number 0 means it's unoccupied and number 1 means it has a token belonging to player 1 while number 2 means a token belonging to player two.

Looking a lot better but it does not look like a grid. Connect 4 as you know is played on a board. Shall we use an html table for this?

So the server is not behaving properly because we are apparently not sending the cookies to the server. How can that be changed

But now that leads to another cors error even though i have flask cors enabled and installed on my server

The way the code is written currently, when the user clicks on a cell the backend api is called and the response is recieved. However immiediately afterwards another request is send to the /start/ endpoint why does this happen and how can we stop it

Now the board is being displayed but it's upside down. In conenct for row 0 is towards the bottom of the page. In other words the columns need to start filling up from the bottom of the screen to the top, how can we achieve it

Can we do the reversing only at the time of display? We are going to have to implement an auto play functionality later on and that code will be harder to write if we reverse IMHO

Now the backend has changed by default to be player vs computer. So instead of just calling the start method when the application loads we need to present a button to the user to start the game. He also needs to have an option of choosing whether it's player vs player or player vs computer mode.
-- the above was filtered out as it matched open source codes

Instead of starting the game automatically when the page is loaded lets give a button to start the game manually
-- here things went wonky i had to do a lot of manual edits to the code to get things back on track

But it seems that the child is not being initialized. Can you look at the context and figure out why that is so
-- this got things mostly back on track. Here all the files were given as context earlier prompts also
-- had several files as context

Instead of displaying numbers 1 and 2, can we have it that we draw a nicely colored blue circle for player 1 and a nicely colored red circle for player 2?

Lets style this page nicely. The board needs to be centered both horizontally and vertically. The start game button should have a resign button as well next to it. We also need a place to display when the game has ended either because the board is full or one or the other players have won it.
-- at this point things got wonky again and manual intervention was required.
-- a lot of manual interventions later it was time to start on the tests

This game-board.component.spec was written long ago, now the game-board.component has changed a lot since that time. Can we update the test to reflect the current version of the component
-- again things got wonky
