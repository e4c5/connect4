This is clearly the naulgar 9 getting started page. I want to get rid of this content and create a simple web page that will hold two buttons. Both buttons will be centered horizontally and vertically. One of the buttons will be start game and another button will be resign game.

So when the start game button is clicked we need to send a get request to http://localhost:5000/start/ method. The response will be a json that looks like this: {"board": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "playing": true}  . the board that to be displayed above the button. The first sub array represents the top row of the board. When the number is 0 and empty cell should be drawn. When the number is 1 a blue circle and when the number is 2 a red circle

How do i Ensure that HttpClientModule is imported in your AppModule to use HttpClient for making HTTP requests.

Now when ever a cell in the table is clicked on by the user, we must call the http://localhost:5000/move/ method. This will be a post request. The data sent will be the column number that was clicked on. The response will be a json similar to the earlier one indicating the new state of the board.

How do i change my code so that cookies are sent with http requests
-- got filtered out

So when the blue and red circles are drawn the grid lines in the board disappear can that be fixed
-- many prompts later it was fixed manually

So the game starts off with a board like this: {"board": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "playing": true} but at some point the playing attribute will change to false. THen we need to disable clicking on the cells or alternatively if the cells are clicked on no action should be taken. The text 'game over' should be displayed somewhere. Additionally the json response will contain a message field when the playing state first become false. The content of the message should be displayed with the game over text
