complete this code
-- over here i took a different approach from angular 6 or 9 by first adding a lengthy
-- comment at the top of the main.c file

Lets add support for AVRO
-- install instructions were wrong. I compiled by clodining https://github.com/apache/avro and
-- following the INSTALL in lang/c


So after installing avro, i get a few errors with the code such as main.c:92:53: error: macro "avro_value_get_size" requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given 92 | size_t n_rows = avro_value_get_size(&board_value); do we have a version compatibility issue?
