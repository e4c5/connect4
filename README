Connect 4 game with multiple frontends
-

This project was created for teaching puporses and I intend to kill multiple birds with a single stone
(metaphorically speaking of course, I am a huge fan of wildlife).

One object is to provide several angular code bases that achieve essentially the same objective. That is
provide a frontend for the connect4 web interface. These will then be used in the study of openrewrite's
angular migration capabilities or indeed any AI based migration tools available.

Another objective was to teach some of my protege's the art of prompt crafting. Much of the code here was
created with copilot rather than being written by hand. The promptes are available in the repo itself.
Sometimes when the project did not give the expected code it was edited manually, at other times i would
repeatedly tweak the prompt until best results were obtained. Almost always context was used. The most
relevant files were explicitly added as context.
